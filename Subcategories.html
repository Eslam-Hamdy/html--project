<h2>Subcategories:</h2>
The discipline of computer architecture has three main subcategories

<h2>Instruction set architecture (ISA):</h2>
 defines the machine code that a processor reads and acts upon as well as the word size, memory address modes, processor registers, and data type.
 
 <h2>Microarchitecture:</h2>
 also known as "computer organization", this describes how a particular processor will implement the ISA.[14] The size of a computer's CPU cache for instance, is an issue that generally has nothing to do with the ISA
 
 <h2>Systems design:</h2>
 includes all of the other hardware components within a computing system, such as data processing other than the CPU (e.g., direct memory access), virtualization, and multiprocessing
